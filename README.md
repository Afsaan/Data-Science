Machine learning models

1 Supervised learning
      a) linear Regression
      b) logistic regression
      c) Decision tree
      d) Random forest
      c) K-NN 
      d) Naive bayes 
      e) Support vector machine (SVM)
      d) kernel SVM
  
 logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, K-NN, Naive bayes, SVM, kernel SVM are also called classification model
 
 2 Unsupervised learning
       a) Hierarchiacal clustering
       b) K-means clustering
